DiscoSheep
==========

A plugin for [Bukkit](http://bukkit.org/), the Minecraft server plugin API. This is a from-scratch remake of the fabulous [DiscoSheep plugin](http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/inactive-fun-discosheep-v0-3-uninvited-guesssts-permissions-and-source-code-522.7106/) which spawns a dance party of sheep at your whim. 

###A note on UUIDs###
DiscoSheep doesn't store anything after a party, and disco-party-on-join is handled by a permissions plugin. Thus, we don't need to worry about the migration to UUIDs.

###Versions###
Tested up to CraftBukkit build #3092 (MC: 1.7.9); can be built with Java 7.
